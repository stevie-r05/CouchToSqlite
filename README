DESCRIPTION
This Java library converts a set of CouchDB databases and documents into a SQLite .db file with tables. The first document in each database is read in and used to set up the column structure of each database table in SQLite. In short:

CouchDB database -> SQLite table
CouchDB document -> SQLite row entry in its corresponding database's table

This project was built as part of a project for a senior undergrad capstone course at Arizona State University. Any sponsor requirements for the project take precedence over any other requests/ideas. Feel free to fork!
