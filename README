Primary Libraries utilized:
CouchDB4J: https://github.com/mbreese/couchdb4j
json-lib: http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/index.html

This Java program takes in a CouchDB instance (defaulted to http://localhost:5984/), asks the user for an output .db file, and converts the CouchDB databases and documents into SQLite. The first document in each database is read in and used to set up the column structure of each database table in SQLite. In short:

CouchDB database -> SQLite table
CouchDB document -> SQLite row entry in its corresponding database's table

This project was built as part of a project for a senior undergrad capstone course at Arizona State University. Any sponsor requirements for the project take precedence over any other requests/ideas. Feel free to fork!
